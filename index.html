                        <p>
                            Hi, you already know who I am but still Ill introduce myself so my name is John Quimbo piro para short you can call me baby. Emz.
So as you knew from Alyza that I like you, piro hindi, I mean joke lang crush talaga kita, piro dati yun and dati is kanina, basta for real I realy like you piro not in a way na I wanna date you, but maybe a little gusto kita maging love of my life, piro feeling ko youre not into this kind of things pa as far as I know.
Even though still Im here having a liking to you and hopefully you can give me a chance to show you how sincere my feelings are and i surely wont disappoint you.
                        </p>
                      <p>Sincerly, J.C.</p>
